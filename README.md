# CrossCode Integer Scaling

Adds in an integer scaling option to video settings. 

This is merely a port of [this repository by @Aemony](https://github.com/Aemony/CrossCode-IntegerScaling) to use proper modding methods. I take no credit for any code besides minor cleanup.

I do not have any plans to provide support for this mod.

Known issue: scaling setting seems to get reset simply by readjusting the window.
